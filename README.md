ToodledoJavaClient
==================

Wrapper around the Toodledo API that I have used in an Android test project of mine

Uses the following libraries:
1) GSON for json parsing
2)Mockito for mocking purposes

I'm fully aware that this is a very thin implementation. It was sufficient for me for playing around with a small Android app that I created to learn me some Android development.

Have fun!
